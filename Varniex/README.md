This repository contains the codes to generate the videos of my YouTube channel [Varniex](https://youtube.com/@Varniex)

The videos are animated using Grant Sanderson's ([3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)) library [ManimGL](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) `v 1.7.1`

> **Note**: There are actually three versions of Manim:
>
> 1. Manim OpenGL ([ManimGL](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)): This version is maintained by 3Blue1Brown.
> 2. [ManimCE](https://manim.community) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)): This version is community maintained. It is better documented for beginners especially. If you are a newbie, I'd suggest you to go with this.
> 3. [Manim Cairo](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/tree/cairo-backend): This is **deprecated** now.
>
> _All of these versions are very different from each other. Please follow the guidelines of the respective version of Manim for its installation and tutorials._
